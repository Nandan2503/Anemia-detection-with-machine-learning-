# 🩺 Anemia Detection with Machine Learning

This project focuses on the **early detection of anemia** using supervised machine learning algorithms based on blood test features. The goal is to help identify anemia in individuals at an early stage using minimal and non-invasive input features.

---

## 📊 Objective

- Predict whether a patient has anemia based on clinical features
- Compare the performance of different ML models (Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression)
- Help in early detection through a web-based application interface

---

## 🧪 Dataset Features

The dataset includes:
- Hemoglobin Level
- Age
- Gender
- RBC count
- MCV, MCH, MCHC, etc.
- Target: Anemia (Yes/No)

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- ✅ **Random Forest**  
- ✅ **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- ✅ **Logistic Regression**

Best performance was achieved using **Random Forest** with the highest accuracy.
